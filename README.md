# Movies ETL

The purpose of this was to automate the process of transforming and loading the data on movies into the existing tables.  This was done by creating a function that takes in information on Wikipedia data, Kaggle metadate and the MovieLens rating data.  I also added a connection to the PostgreSQL database that imported the data into the table.

It is amazing to see the amount of data that can be cleaned in a short period of time and imported into a database with code.  I know it takes work up front but it saves a lot of time on a recurring task!
