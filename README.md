# Movies_ETL

#The purpose of this was to automate the process of transforming and loading the data on movies into the existing tables.  This was done by creating a function that takes in information on Wikipedia data, Kaggle metadate and the MovieLens rating data.  I also added a connection to the PostgreSQL database that imported the data into the table.
